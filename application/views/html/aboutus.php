                        <h3>we are Mithra Seva Samithi</h3>
                        <p class="p-custom">Mithra SevaSamithi is a non-profit, registered society formed in the year 2008 under the guidance of Shri.N.Nagaraj(Founder), the idea of samithi was first coined by group of friends who had faced various problems in the society,which cannot be solved by one individual. Where they need a moral support and back-up, it is clear in their minds that an individual cannot change the things but a group can affect the society as a whole.</p>   
						<p class="p-custom">From the above, the group of friends felt that to get a presence or identity in society, the everyperson needs a group. If we take into considerations there are various groups which are established on basis of caste, creed, religion, economic sections etc. If we see the above groups we find of complex issues such as it can serve to the limited members of the society. But a association which is founded with the persons who belongs to different cultures, religions and economic backgrounds and having the bond of relation on the platform of friendship which will flourish for the entire life of the person and can serve the entire society without any bounds.</p>
